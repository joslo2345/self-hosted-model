Every package records at least one measured number here. Hardware: Apple M3 Pro, 36 GB.

## B1 · Local serving smoke test (2026-10-02)

Engine: vLLM 0.30.0 + vllm-metal 0.30.0 (MLX, Apple GPU). Model: `mlx-community/Qwen3.5-9B-MLX-8bit`

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Weights on disk | 10.5 GB |
| Engine start to ready (warm cache) | ~55 s (engine init 20 s) |
| KV + state cache allocated | 15.05 GiB |
| Decode speed, one request | ~11 tokens/s |
| `make smoke`: chat / stream / tool call | PASS 19.1 s / PASS 15.1 s / PASS 64.6 s |
| "Reply with one word" request | 110 completion tokens, 106 of them reasoning |

Thinking mode is on by default and accounts for nearly all of the latency. The decode speed is
close to the memory-bandwidth limit for ~10 GB of weights on an M3 Pro (150 GB/s), so the
comparison runs have to control thinking. Quantization alone won't fix it.
